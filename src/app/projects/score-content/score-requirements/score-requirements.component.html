    Fundamental Design Requirement For Score.
  </span>

  <span class="small-space"></span>

  <span class="bold-sub-heading">
    Nurturing and accepting the relationship between money and emotions through
    design.
  </span>
  <span class="small-space"></span>

  <span class="body">
    A common trend in Fintech UI design, is an acceptance that money influences
    the users emotions ,and therefore the design of the Fintech product needs to
    be well positioned to mediate and manage this relationship. A common way to
    do this is to humanise and socialise Fintech apps with emojiâ€™s and pop up
    messages and alerts that actively manage the emotions of the user. These
    features have been included in the design of Score.

  <span class="body">
    Furthermore, the selected colours and typography included in the design are
    strategic, so that Score can successfully keep the users motivated and calm
    throughout their experience with Score.
